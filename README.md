Visualize stocks from Yahoo finance. 

The intention is to alert and email users when the tracked stock(s) crosses the lower Bollinger Band.

Todo list:

* Email formatting
* Additional Flagged alerts when the crossing does happen, instead of just the visualisation
* Alternative email accounts for the aforementioned flagged alerts
* Better toml formatting
* Description of setting cron job/event handler for automatic setup.
